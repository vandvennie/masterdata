1. Problem: Power-off protection: When the network connection of the smart baby cradle is disconnected or unstable, or the power of the smart baby cradle is disconnected, causing the smart baby cradle to lose connection, the system should promptly issue an alarm to the baby's parents and take appropriate protective measures to avoid the failure of monitoring and notification functions due to loss of connection.
Solution: Use heartbeat signals and regular checks to determine whether the network is connected normally, and use voltage monitors to detect changes in power supply voltage. If the network of the device is disconnected or the voltage is below a certain threshold, a sound alarm is issued in time. The device can notify people at home through audible alarms or visual indications (such as LED flashing). The device should have local storage facilities to ensure that information can be stored locally in time when the network is disconnected.
2. Problem: Leakage protection: By monitoring the current and voltage of the device in real time, any abnormal current flow is detected, especially leakage current that may cause electric shock. The system should promptly alert the user and take appropriate protective measures.
Solution: Install a leakage circuit breaker at the power inlet of the device to detect unbalanced current in the device circuit. When a leakage current exceeding the safety threshold is detected, the power is immediately cut off and the user is notified by a warning sound.
