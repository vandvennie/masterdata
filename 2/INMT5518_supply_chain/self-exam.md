\- A) Linear Regression 

\- B) Moving Averages 

\- C) Decision Trees 

\- D) Scatter Plot

 

**Answer**: B) **Moving Averages**

 

**Explanation**: Moving Averages is a popular technique in time series forecasting used to smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends. It involves calculating the average of different subsets of the dataset over time to predict future data points.

 

\---

 

\### **2. In a time series analysis, which of the following components is used to describe seasonal fluctuations in data that repeat at regular intervals?**

 

\- A) Trend 

\- B) Seasonality 

\- C) Cyclic Patterns 

\- D) Random Variations

 

**Answer**: B) **Seasonality**

 

**Explanation**: **Seasonality** refers to regular patterns that repeat over consistent intervals, such as sales peaks during holiday seasons or weather-related patterns. These repeating cycles are crucial in time series analysis to forecast future data with periodic trends.

 

\---

 

\### **3. Which of the following best describes the R-squared value in regression analysis?**

 

\- A) It measures the accuracy of the forecasted values. 

\- B) It represents the error term in the regression model. 

\- C) It shows how well the independent variables explain the variance in the dependent variable. 

\- D) It is the coefficient of the independent variable.

 

**Answer**: C) **It shows how well the independent variables explain the variance in the dependent variable.**

 

**Explanation**: The R-squared value, also known as the coefficient of determination, indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. A higher R-squared value suggests a better fit of the model to the data.

 

\---

 

\### **4. When using linear regression for forecasting, the equation of the regression line is given as \(Y = a + bX\). What does the coefficient \(b\) represent?**

 

\- A) The intercept of the regression line

**Explanation**: In linear regression, \(b\) represents the slope of the regression line. It indicates how much the dependent variable \(Y\) is expected to change for each one-unit change in the independent variable \(X\). The intercept \(a\) represents the value of \(Y\) when \(X = 0\).

 

\---

 

\### **5. If a time series has both a linear trend and seasonality, which of the following models would be appropriate for forecasting?**

 

\- A) Simple Linear Regression 

\- B) Exponential Smoothing 

\- C) ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) 

\- D) Moving Averages

 

**Answer**: C) **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**

 

**Explanation**: The **ARIMA** model is a powerful tool in time series forecasting that can handle both trend and seasonality in data. It incorporates autoregression (AR), differencing to remove trends (I), and moving averages (MA) to account for past errors.

 

\---

 

\### **6. Which of the following accuracy measures is used to express the average of the squared differences between actual and forecasted values?**

 

\- A) Mean Absolute Error (MAE) 

\- B) Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) 

\- C) Mean Squared Error (MSE) 

\- D) R-squared

 

**Answer**: C) **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**

 

**Explanation**: **MSE** measures the average of the squares of the errors, which are the differences between the actual and forecasted values. Squaring the differences helps penalize larger errors more heavily. It is commonly used to assess the accuracy of a forecasting model.

 

\---

 

\### **7. Which of the following time series forecasting techniques applies decreasing weights to past data points, placing more emphasis on recent data?**

 

\- A) Moving Averages 

\- B) Simple Linear Regression 

\- C) Exponential Smoothing 

\- D) Decision Trees

 

**Answer**: C) **Exponential Smoothing**

 

**Explanation**: **Exponential Smoothing** is a forecasting technique that applies exponentially decreasing weights to older data, emphasizing recent observations. This makes it suitable for time series with patterns that change over time.

 

\---

 

\### **8. What is the purpose of differencing in an ARIMA model?**

 

\- A) To remove the trend component from the time series data 

\- B) To amplify the cyclic patterns in the data 

\- C) To smooth out random variations 

\- D) To calculate the average forecast error

 

**Answer**: A) **To remove the trend component from the time series data**

 

**Explanation**: Differencing is used in an ARIMA model to make a time series stationary by removing trends. By calculating the differences between consecutive data points, the model can focus on the underlying seasonality and cyclic patterns, making it easier to forecast future values.

- B) Displaying all available data to give the user maximum information  
- C) Focusing on key performance indicators (KPIs) and avoiding clutter  
- D) Presenting all data in tabular form for accuracy

**Answer**: C) **Focusing on key performance indicators (KPIs) and avoiding clutter**

**Explanation**: A well-designed dashboard should be focused and uncluttered, highlighting key performance indicators (KPIs) that are most relevant to the user's goals. Overloading a dashboard with too much information or unnecessary visuals can make it harder to interpret.

---

### **4. Which type of chart is most appropriate for visualising changes in data over time?**

- A) Pie Chart  
- B) Line Chart  
- C) Histogram  
- D) Scatter Plot

**Answer**: B) **Line Chart**

- A) Line Chart  
- B) Bar Chart  
- C) Scatter Plot  
- D) Pie Chart

**Answer**: B) **Bar Chart**

**Explanation**: Bar charts are effective for comparing the frequency or value of different categories within a dataset. They display data in rectangular bars, making it easy to compare the lengths (or heights) of the bars to see which categories are larger or smaller.

---

### **7. Why is it important to minimize the use of too many colors in a dashboard?**

- A) To save ink when printing the dashboard  
- B) To avoid overwhelming users and maintain visual clarity  
- C) To ensure that the dashboard looks professional  
- D) To make sure all charts use the same color scheme

**Answer**: B) **To avoid overwhelming users and maintain visual clarity**

**Explanation**: Using too many colors can distract users and make the dashboard harder to interpret. Effective dashboards use a limited color palette to highlight important information and maintain consistency, ensuring that the visualisation is clear and easy to understand.
