Interrogating Data

- **Drilling Up and Down**: Techniques used in databases to explore different levels of data detail.
- **Drill Through**: Allows selecting part of a visual to access another page in the report, filtered by the selected data.
- **Filter vs. Highlight**:
  - **Filter**: Removes data that doesn’t apply.
  - **Highlight**: Greys out data that isn’t relevant but keeps it visible.

Databases vs. Spreadsheets

- **Databases**:
  - Support multiple users and simultaneous data interaction.
  - Provide better performance on large datasets.
  - Allow finer-grained access control.
- **Spreadsheets**:
  - Designed for simpler data tasks for a single user.

Data Model Formats in a Database

- **Relational Databases**:
  - Use tables with rows and columns for data structuring.
  - Efficiently manage data as rows have consistent columns.
  - Allow manipulation through SQL and DBMS.

Business Decision Making & Databases

- **Database and BI Tools Integration**: Helps businesses make timely and efficient decisions, enhancing agility and scalability.
- **DBMS Performance**: Ensures fast storage, access, and analysis of data to provide timely insights.

Database Keys

- **Primary Key (PK)**: A unique identifier for each record in a table.
- **Foreign Key (FK)**: A reference to a PK in another table, establishing a relational link.

Relationship

​	One to Many (1:M): One record in a table is linked to many records in another table.

​	Many to One (M:1): Many records in other tables are linked to one record in a table.
​	One to One (1:1): One record in one table is linked to exactly one record in another.

Security Issues

• Ensure that you are using a strong username and password;
• Minimal permissions to each group that has them – internet availability;
• Keep software up to date to ensure bugs/exploits are patched;
• Ensure audit logs and technical solutions are enabled and utilised.

Ethical & Privacy Issues

- Using data responsibly and with consent, especially for targeted marketing, prediction models, and data security.
- • Targeted advertising based upon previous behaviour – limited surveillance;
  • Prediction of health outcomes (e.g. insurance) based upon some form of personal data;
  • Automatic prediction of outcomes from data – ‘stereotypes刻板印象’;
  • Using data for purposes not originally consented to;
  • Email mailing list sign ups – laws should protect against this.
  Ethical Issues
- Private data should remain just that – it is unethical to provide this data to those who
  don’t need it and for purposes other than agreed to.
  • Private data required for legitimate business purposes;
  • Erosion of this privacy may cause fraud or embarrassment;
  • Technical controls should be used to achieve this – alongside social ones!

- **Distributed**: Data spread across multiple nodes.
- **Immutable**: Transactions cannot be altered.
- **Use Cases**: Cryptocurrency, NFTs, smart contracts.
- Eg. Cryptocurrency, NFT’s, Smart Contracts
